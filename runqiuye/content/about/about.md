I am an undergraduate student in Carnegie Mellon University. I am 
interested in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics. Specifically,
I am passionate about analysis, machine learning, and computer systems.
I also like doing sports, cooking, and listening to classical music.

On this website, I will share stuff I found interesting relevant to Mathematics,
Computer Science, and Physics, mostly containing my notes and projects.
